# DSA
## LeetCode Solutions Repository

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! This repository contains my solutions to various coding problems from LeetCode. The primary purpose of maintaining this repository is to track my progress in improving my data structures and algorithms (DSA) skills.

## About Me
My name is Mohana Manikanta Reddy Padala, and I am passionate about problem-solving and honing my programming skills. I have been actively participating in LeetCode, an online platform that provides a collection of coding interview questions, to enhance my understanding of DSA concepts.

## LeetCode Profile
You can find my LeetCode profile [here](https://leetcode.com/Mohana_Manikanta_Reddy_Padala/). Feel free to visit it to explore my submissions, check problem statistics, and browse through my solved problems.


## Contribution
While this repository primarily serves as a personal record of my LeetCode solutions, I welcome contributions from others who might find it useful. If you come across any issues, have more optimized solutions, or wish to add new problems, feel free to submit a pull request. Let's collaborate and learn together!

## Disclaimer
Please note that these solutions are my personal attempts and may not always be the most optimal or best solutions available. There can be multiple approaches to solve a problem, and the solutions provided here represent my understanding at the time of submission.
